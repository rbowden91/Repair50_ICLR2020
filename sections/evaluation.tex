\subsection{Methodology}

Python and Tensorflow Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080Ti

Cross-validation? Trained until convergence?

Each relation introduces $X$ new parameters. As such,
to keep the number of parameters across all tests roughly the same, 

%Analysis of emphasis of the components of hpred?

Compare against Seq2Tree, Tree2Seq, and Tree2Tree

\subsection{IFTTT Task}
Compare against the grammar paper and DRNN (and Seq2DRNN-SynC?).
For a fair comparison, we implemented the fix within the code of DRNN, available 
at. Note that this does not include.  IFTT

\subsection{Variable Hole Task}

Relational pointer networks. In this task, we But not misuse or name
Compared against the version where we just condition on $h_{pred}$, we get:
